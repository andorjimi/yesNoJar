# Yes No Jar

## The Game
For many years while growing up, my mother would use a little jar with small scraps of folded paper with either the words "yes", "no", or blank. She would use this jar when needed to decide about something. 

The game itself is very simple.
1. Think of your question.
2. click the button and read the answer. Then
## Goal

My goal with this project is to practice using DOM, HTML, CSS and Javascript on a web page.

I thought that this would be quite simple, giving me practice on some of the basic fundaments of web development.
